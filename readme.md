What operating system and IDE you used to run and compile your code.

    operating system: ubuntu 22.04.1 LTS, ide: text editor
    run and compile using terminal using cMakeLists.txt
    cMakeLists.txt: have the exectutables and libraries needed for opencv
    

    To make the project executable create a folder in the parent folder 
                mkdir build/
                cmake -S . -B build/
    
    CHANGE DIRECTORY    
                cd build/
                make
    Now two exectuables will be created
    for all task except seven run:
                ./augmentation

        To save the calibration enter 's' to save calibraion then press 'e' for execution
        press 'q' to quit

    Task 7:            
                ./harryC
        press 'q' to quit
